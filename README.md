Task 1: Use liburl to retrieve historical price data from eodhistoricaldata.com: A function 
retrieves the adjusted close prices for selected Russell 3000 stocks and IWV
(Russell 3000 ETF used as market benchmark) into memory.

This program is able to:

for dates and adjusted closing prices.

o Populate the stock maps and AAR/CAAR matrix.
o Show the gnuplot graph with CAAR for all 3 groups.


Task 2: Project Design:
a) Create classes and data structure such as vectors, matrix, and maps.
b) Figure out how to handle historical price retrieval from eodhistoricaldata.com for all 
IWV 3000 stocks and the benchmark IWV, and parse the retrieved data.
c) Figure out how to implement your Bootstrap algorithm?
d) Write member function or independent functions (with operator overloading) for all 
the calculation.
e) Design and implement menu
4
Task 3: Figure out how to implement menu options and graphing your results with gnuplot.
Task 4: Divide the project into modules and assign team members working on each module.
